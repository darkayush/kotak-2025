Our governance framework reinforces this commitment towards
our customers. The Board-level Customer Service Committee

strategy, monitoring both qualitative and quantitative indicators
such as digital engagement, resolution effectiveness, and

Innovation, for us, is not just about new products- it’s
about creating meaningful ecosystems that empower our

Assistance Program — a proactive initiative that reimagined
traditional lending through the lens of empathy and
adaptability. This program offers eligible customers tailored
support during their periods of financial stress, providing
flexible payment options and temporary relief to ease their

We provide weekly learning series and annual certifications for

banking practices such as prevention of fraud. This facilitates
proactive protection of customers from negative experiences,
protection of customer interests and delivery of better service
quality through confident interactions.
</p>
Measures taken by Branch staff in detecting and preventing
frauds are also highlighted internally to create awareness and
encourage the staff to be extra vigilant, especially towards
vulnerable sections such as Senior Citizens. The common
modus/scenarios identified, are detailed to Branch staff and
customers, and they are encouraged to report a fraud or any
suspicious activity, using Kotak fraud reporting helpline or
the government cybercrime helpline. The effectiveness of our
awareness programs is reflected through real time instances of
staff preventing fraudulent transactions and providing timely
alerts to customers. Such proactive efforts of employees are
also amplified via “Hall of Fame” and “Hawk Eye” mailers to
appreciate them and inspire other employees.

  <p className='mb-2'>
At one of our Hyderabad branches, a potential fraud
amounting to approximately ₹30 lakh was successfully
averted through the vigilance and coordinated efforts of our
frontline staff. When a senior citizen customer requested
premature closure of a term deposit and an immediate
RTGS transfer, our staff sensed unusual behaviour and
escalated the matter.
  </p>
  <p className='mb-2'>
Upon further engagement, it was discovered that the
customer had been coerced by fraudsters impersonating
law enforcement officials. The branch team acted swiftly —
declining the transaction, maintaining communication with
the customer’s spouse, involving a trusted family friend,
and alerting the customer’s children abroad. After sustained
efforts, the customer was convinced of the fraudulent
nature of the threat.
  </p>
  <p className='mb-2'>
This incident underscored the impact of our fraud
awareness training and the critical role of frontline staff
in protecting vulnerable customers through proactive,
empathetic intervention.

  <p className='mb-2'>
At one of our branches in Pondicherry, a high-value fraud
attempt involving ₹75 lakh was successfully intercepted
through the vigilance and persistence of our branch
team. A long-standing HNI customer arrived in a visibly
distressed state, urgently requesting a large RTGS transfer.
His behaviour raised immediate red flags — he was
evasive, uncommunicative and appeared to be under
external pressure. When verbal communication proved
ineffective, the team resorted to written notes to discreetly
assess the situation.
  </p>
  <p className='mb-2'>
The branch contacted the beneficiary bank, which
confirmed suspicious activity in the recipient account.
Continued engagement revealed that the customer had
been coerced via a video call by fraudsters impersonating
government officials. The team’s calm, methodical
approach — grounded in recent internal fraud awareness
training — ultimately convinced the customer to disengage
and report the incident.
  </p>

This structure of grievance redressal process covers two
escalation levels and ensures that every voice is heard and
every issue is addressed with the seriousness it deserves.
In line with the Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines, we have
also institutionalized the role of an Internal Ombudsman—an
independent authority whose decisions are binding on the Bank.
This reinforces our commitment to fairness, impartiality and
regulatory compliance.
  </p>
  <p className='mb-2'>
The Salesforce CRM system has empowered our frontline teams
with real-time access to customer information and enabling
faster and more accurate resolution of issues. The system
ensures end-to-end tracking, categorization and root-cause
analysis of every complaint—turning data into actionable
insights that drive continuous improvement.
  </p>
  <p className='mb-2'>
    In FY 2024-25, we reinforced our grievance redressal framework
by fortifying our Internal Ombudsman Support Desk with 11
members working closely with the 3 Internal Ombudsmen to
address escalated issues effectively. We also updated policies
and improved processes for ATM and cash-related disputes
  </p>
  <p className='mb-2'>
To ensure transparency, we have implemented a rigorous
tracking system. Every complaint is assigned a Turnaround Time

identifying root causes, and driving targeted interventions across
policy, process and technology.

KSL implemented a structured and insight-driven approach to
enhance customer satisfaction and service quality. A formal
service recovery mechanism ensures that unresolved issues
are addressed comprehensively, while detractor feedback is
systematically analysed to generate actionable insights. These
insights are shared across relevant functions — including
operations, product, and training — to drive targeted
improvements. KSL also channels process-related feedback to its
process improvement team, ensuring continuous refinement of
service delivery. This year, KSL further strengthened its customer

<div className='mb-2'>
  These efforts are already delivering measurable impact. In
FY 2024–25, we achieved a notable reduction in complaint
volumes across key categories: 12% reduction in complaints
belonging to Kotak bank ATMs, 32% decline in the complaints
related to usage of our Bank’s cards at non-Kotak bank ATMs,
and 4% reduction in Kotak CRM related complaints.
</div>
<div>
  Our AI- and ML-powered tools proactively identified potential
escalations and helped resolve issues before they intensified.
Additionally, validations and automated execution of service
requests through APIs streamlined the service request journey,
resulting in 40% of requests being processed automatically.
These interventions supported by a dedicated Kaizen team,
led to 28% YoY reduction in net complaints and 9.13% YoY
drop in Banking Ombudsman complaints. These initiatives
also contributed to the increase in RNPS score that measures
overall customer satisfaction.
</div>
</div>
<p className='mb-2'>
Our measures and the impact stated above, reflects our commitment to eliminate the root cause of the issues rather than just
resolving them. This approach has transformed grievance redressal mechanism into a catalyst for continuous innovation and
operational resilience.
</p>
<p className='mb-2'>
At Kotak, customer satisfaction is not just a metric — it’s a mindset that drives all our decisions. By embedding innovation, resilience,
agility and empathy into our service ethos while we are resolving problems—we are also simultaneously building a stronger and more
responsive Kotak of the future.
