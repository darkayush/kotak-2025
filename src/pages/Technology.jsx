                        During FY 2024-25, we undertook a comprehensive upgrade of the
                        technology infrastructure and enhanced the UI/UX and core features of
                        its apps and platforms. This transformation was driven by the strategic
                        belief that building a resilient, secure and scalable core is fundamental
                        to delivering improved customer experiences in an increasingly digitalfirst world. These efforts also resulted in resolving the regulatory
                        restrictions highlighted in the RBI Order dated 24th April, 2024,
                        which were subsequently removed by its letter dated 12th February, 2025.

                        and scalability, we initiated several strategic actions. Key among them
