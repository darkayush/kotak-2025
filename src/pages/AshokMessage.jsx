                    Last year is best described as one of resilience, recovery,
                    reinvention and realignment, both in the external world
                    and within Kotak.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The heightened geo-political situation and a rapidly evolving,
                    volatile global economic order are the new realities that
                    have compelled all countries, including India, to realign. The
                    Indian economy proved resilient, growing at 6.5%. Growth
                    recovered in the second half of the year, supported by the
                    RBI’s efforts to revive momentum through interest rate
                    reductions and a liquidity boost. These developments naturally
                    impacted our business.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Specific to Kotak, early in the year, the RBI directed us to
                    strengthen our technology platform, pause digital onboarding
                    of new customers and issuance of new credit cards. The team
                    demonstrated a great deal of resilience in resolving the issues
                    comprehensively to the RBI’s satisfaction. The embargo was
                    lifted in February 2025. Separately last year, the microfinance
                    industry faced a significant downturn. This required us to
                    make some changes to strengthen our operating model. While
                    doing all of this, we remained focused on our broader goal of
                    transforming for scale by leveraging technology and continuing
                    to realign our culture with a sharper focus on customer centricity
                    and collaboration.

                    Stepping back from the immediate, let me turn to the strategic
                    vision and roadmap we set out in the early part of calendar year
                    2024. We committed to transforming our business for scale.
                    Scale, not just for the sake of size but for relevance, with a singleminded focus on the customer.

                    <br />
                    Building on that strategic intent, let me now turn to how Kotak’s
                    unique position as a diversified financial services conglomerate
                    with interests in Banking, Capital Markets, Asset Management
                    and Insurance, is a key enabler of this strategy. Thus, we have
                    the entire range of financial products and services; and the goal
                    is to leverage technology to pull together relevant products and
                    services to meet the needs of our various customer segments.
                    What I am proud of is that while the immediate challenges did
                    take a lot of resources and management bandwidth, we have
                    made solid progress on our strategic roadmap as well.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We said we would measure our progress against our four key
                    stakeholders - Customer, Company, Colleague and Community.

                    We have made significant strides in enhancing our customer
                    experience. Our digital onboarding process is now more

                    Given the breadth of our product and service capabilities, our
                    focus has been on integrating relevant products and services
                    across the Group for our defined target customer segments.
                    This is best illustrated in our offering for HNI & Ultra HNI
                    customers through our Private Bank, which manages wealth for
                    60% of India’s top 100 families. It is equally evident in our 811
                    proposition, which resonates strongly with core India. While
                    we had paused digital customer acquisitions during the year
                    through the 811 app, we significantly deepened relationships
                    with existing ones. Our SME proposition also saw strong growth.
                    Most recently, we launched the Solitaire proposition for affluent
                    customers and early feedback has been encouraging.

                    We invested significantly in building resilience, capacity and
                    security. Despite the embargo, we redefined our go-to-market
                    strategy with two apps, the new Kotak Mobile Banking App
                    and the new 811 App, targeting affluent and core customers
                    respectively. These persona-based apps enable us to deliver the
                    right product and proposition to each customer segment. They
                    are complemented by Neo, Kotak Securities’ app for traders and
                    Cherry, an investment-only app for banking customers. We also
                    enhanced our net banking platform for corporate clients — fyn.
                    We have made considerable progress in comprehensively
                    reviewing all customer journeys - simplifying, re-engineering,
                    centralising, automating and digitising. This is a multi-year
                    effort. The early results have been gratifying with net customer
                    complaints declining by over 28% during the year, with increased
                    throughput and improved productivity.

                    Primarily, we measure ourselves on book value per share. We
                    delivered a 21% growth on this metric. From a risk appetite
                    perspective, we target to grow assets at 1.5 to 2 times nominal
                    GDP growth. In FY 2024-25, our average advances grew by 18%,
                    in line with our risk appetite, and average deposits by 16%, to
                    ensure a balanced customer growth franchise. The technology

                    We are committed to giving back to the community in which we
                    live. We understand that our prosperity is inherently linked to
                    theirs. We are immensely proud of the work that we do in the
                    community focused on financial inclusion, education, healthcare
                    and sustainability. We recognise that economic growth and jobs
                    is what will power India ahead and that it is essential that this
                    growth be evenly spread and lift as many boats as possible.
                    Towards this objective, we have launched Kotak Biz Labs - a
                    programme to help entrepreneurs grow and scale up.

                    Finally, our brand Kotak has been built brick by brick, with
                    ambition and hard work. Over the years, our vision and
                    aspirations have evolved to achieve the audacious. That is
                    who we are, and who we will always be. And that is what India
                    represents, the bold hopes and aspirations of over a billion
                    people. We are committed to partnering with aspirational India,
                    because we believe - <span className='text-[#ed1c2f] font-medium'>Hausla hai toh <i>ho jayega!</i></span>

                    While, last year was eventful, we made substantial progress
                    in laying the foundations of our transformation journey. We
                    expect momentum to build in the years ahead. We thank you
                    for your continued support and remain committed to building a
                    franchise you are proud of.
