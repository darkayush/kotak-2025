                        Last year is best described as one of resilience, recovery,
                        reinvention and realignment, both in the external world

                        The heightened geo-political situation and a rapidly evolving,
                        volatile global economic order are the new realities that
                        have compelled all countries, including India, to realign. The
                        Indian economy proved resilient, growing at 6.5%. Growth
                        recovered in the second half of the year, supported by the
                        RBI’s efforts to revive momentum through interest rate
                        reductions and a liquidity boost. These developments naturally
                        impacted our business.

                    <p className='mb-2'>
                        Specific to Kotak, early in the year, the RBI directed us to
                        strengthen our technology platform, pause digital onboarding
                        of new customers and issuance of new credit cards. The team
                        demonstrated a great deal of resilience in resolving the issues
                        comprehensively to the RBI’s satisfaction. The embargo was
                        lifted in February 2025. Separately last year, the microfinance
                        industry faced a significant downturn. This required us to
                        make some changes to strengthen our operating model. While
                        doing all of this, we remained focused on our broader goal of
                        transforming for scale by leveraging technology and continuing
                        to realign our culture with a sharper focus on customer centricity
                        and collaboration.

                        Stepping back from the immediate, let me turn to the strategic
                        vision and roadmap we set out in the early part of calendar year
                        2024. We committed to transforming our business for scale.

                        Building on that strategic intent, let me now turn to how Kotak’s
                        unique position as a diversified financial services conglomerate
                        with interests in Banking, Capital Markets, Asset Management
                        and Insurance, is a key enabler of this strategy. Thus, we have
                        the entire range of financial products and services; and the goal
                        is to leverage technology to pull together relevant products and
                        services to meet the needs of our various customer segments.
                        What I am proud of is that while the immediate challenges did
                        take a lot of resources and management bandwidth, we have
                        made solid progress on our strategic roadmap as well.

                        across the Group for our defined target customer segments.
                        This is best illustrated in our offering for HNI & Ultra HNI
                        customers through our Private Bank, which manages wealth for
                        60% of India’s top 100 families. It is equally evident in our 811

                        we had paused digital customer acquisitions during the year
                        through the 811 app, we significantly deepened relationships
                        with existing ones. Our SME proposition also saw strong growth.
                        Most recently, we launched the Solitaire proposition for affluent

                        We invested significantly in building resilience, capacity and
                        security. Despite the embargo, we redefined our go-to-market
                        strategy with two apps, the new Kotak Mobile Banking App
                        and the new 811 App, targeting affluent and core customers

                        enhanced our net banking platform for corporate clients — fyn.
                        We have made considerable progress in comprehensively

                        GDP growth. In FY 2024-25, our average advances grew by 18%,

                    needed for the new age. All of this while ensuring that we build

                    next level.

                    We are committed to giving back to the community in which we
                    live. We understand that our prosperity is inherently linked to
                    theirs. We are immensely proud of the work that we do in the
                    community focused on financial inclusion, education, healthcare
                    and sustainability. We recognise that economic growth and jobs
                    is what will power India ahead and that it is essential that this
                    growth be evenly spread and lift as many boats as possible.
                    Towards this objective, we have launched Kotak Biz Labs - a
                    programme to help entrepreneurs grow and scale up.
