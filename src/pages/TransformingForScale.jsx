                        We have embarked on a journey to transform at scale. We are currently navigating this multi-year transformation and have made meaningful progress. This is a journey to become a customer-centric organisation.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        This transformation is being driven ground up, anchored in simple but pertinent principles of speed, simplicity, transparency and technology. These principles are being seamlessly integrated across all customer-facing channels and internal processes that shape the customer experience. Our ultimate aspiration is to deepen customer relationships and deliver exceptional value.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        While we transform for scale, we want scale for relevance and not just for the sake of size. We want responsible scale. Scale that does not dilute our ethos of risk management and profitability. Scale that is sustainable, inclusive and anchored in long-term value creation.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        We recognise that our colleagues play a critical role in this journey of transformation. Their empowerment is central to our strategy, and we have invested in enabling them through tools such as digital automation and AI-powered chatbots. We have also infused external talent, as we saw fit, including strengthening our technology talent teams.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Additionally, the counter-cyclical benefits derived from the diversified business mix of our group companies, spanning Banking & Lending, Capital Markets, Asset Management and Protection, and our fortress-like balance sheet, provide resilience and stability in our financial outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With all of these elements in place, the organisation is poised to deliver growth and continue to create sustainable value for its shareholders.
